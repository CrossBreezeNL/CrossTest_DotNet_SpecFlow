# Introduction
This wiki contains the documentation of the .NET/Specflow version of CrossTest.
The documentation of the Cucumber/Java version can be found [here](../Java)

## What is CrossTest
CrossTest is a library implementing Gherkin that can be used to easily implement test automation on a data solution, for instance on a data warehouse, using Specflow or Cucumber. 

### Using CrossTest with Specflow
CrossTest is available as a .NET/Specflow library through NuGet. With CrossTest you can implement test scenarios that insert test data, execute processes (like stored procedures, functions and SSIS packages) and compare the actual and expected output.

Use the Specflow implementation if you are using the Microsoft SQL Server stack.

To get started with the .NET/Specflow version of CrossTest go to [Getting Started](./GettingStarted).
